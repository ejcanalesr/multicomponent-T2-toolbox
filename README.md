The current implementation is written in Python 2.7 (we plan to switch to Python 3.x.)

Ten estimation algorithms are currently implemented, including the individual combinations of three penalty terms (i.e., **I** = identity matrix, **L1** = first-order Laplacian derivative, and **L2** = second-order Laplacian derivative) with three criteria to estimate the optimal regularization weight (i.e., Chi-square residual fitting (**X2**), **L-curve**, and Generalized Cross-Validation (**GCV**)), as well as the non-regularized Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS). All algorithms were named based on the resulting combination: `X2-I, X2-L1, X2-L2, L-curve-I, L-curve-L1, L-curve-L2, GCV-I, GCV-L1, GCV-L2, and NNLS`.
